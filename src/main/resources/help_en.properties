help.chartsaspects.title=Aspects
help.chartsaspects.content=This screen shows an overview of the aspects from the currrent chart.<br> \
  <ul><li>The first three columns contain the symbols of the points that form an aspect and a symbol for the aspect itself. </li> \
  <li>In the column <i>Effective orb</i> you see the orb for this aspect. </li> \
  <li>The column <i>Percentage</i> shows the percentage of the orb. If the maximum orb for this combination is 8 degrees, \
  and the actual orb is 2 degrees, the percentage will be 25%. </li></ul><br> \
  To close this screen click the button <b>Exit</b>.
help.chartsdata.title=Chart data
help.chartsdata.content=In the tables on this screen you will find all calculated data for a specific chart.<br> \
  The top table shows all data for planets and other points.<br> \
  From left to right you see the following: \
  <ul>\
  <li>The glyph of the planet or point.</li>\
  <li>The longitude.</li>\
  <li>The glyph of the ecliptical sign.</li>\
  <li><b>Speed (long)</b>: the speed in longitude for one day. A negative value indicates retrogradation.</li>\
  <li><b>Latitude</b>. The distance from the ecliptic. Positive values are northern, negative values are southern.</li>\
  <li><b>Speed (lat)</b>. The speed of the change in latitude during one day.</li>\
  <li><b>RA</b>. The Right Ascension, measured in degrees.</li>\
  <li><b>Speed (ra)</b>. The speed of the change in right ascension during one day.</li>\
  <li><b>Declination</b>. The distance from the equator. Positive values are northern, negative values are southern.</li>\
  <li><b>Speed (decl)</b>. The speed of the change in declination during one day.</li>\
  <li><b>Azimuth</b>. The <I>compass direction</i>, measured from the south, via the west and north to the east.</li>\
  <li><b>Altitude</b>. The <i>height</i> above (positive values) or under (negative values) the horizon.</li>\
  <li><b>Distance</b>. Technically the <i>Radius Vector</i>, the distance measured in <i>AU</i> (Astronomical Units).</li>\
  <li><b>Speed (dist)</b>. The speed of the change in distance during one day.</li>\
  </ul><br>\
  In the table down left you see the values for the <i>houses</i>, <i>MC</i>, <i>Ascendant</i> (Asc), <i>Vertex</i> (Vx) and <i>Eastpoint</i> (EP). <br>\
  Houses do not have latitude nor distance and the speed is irrelevant. But you do find the following data:\
  <ul>\
  <li>Longitude</li>\
  <li>RA</li>\
  <li>Declination</li>\
  <li>Azimuth</li>\
  <li>Altitude</li>\
  </ul><br>\
  In the space down right you will see general information about this chart.<br><br>\
  You can close this screen by pressing the button <b>Close</b>.

<ul><li>The input fields <b>Source for data</b>, <b>Description</b> and <b>Name of locationOld</b> are optional.</li>\
<li><b>Name or identification</b> has to contain at least one character and it should not yet exist in the database.</li>\
<li>You can select the <b>Rodden classification</b> or ignore it by selecting <i>ZZ - Unknown</i>. \
<li>For <b>Longitude</b> enter degrees, minutes and optionally seconds and separate the values with a colon.\
The maximum value can be 180 degrees. Select <b>E</b> or <b>W</b> for East or West.</li> \
<li>For <b>Latitude</b> use the same procedure as for longitude. \
The latitude is always less than 90 degrees. Select <b>N</b> or <b>S</b> for North or South.</li>\
<li>For the <b>Date</b> enter year, month and day (in that sequence) and separate the items with a slash. \
Enter <b>G</b> or <b>J</b> for Gregorian calendar or Julian calendar. </li>\
<li>For the <b>Time</b> enter hours, minutes and possibly seconds (in that sequence) and separate the values with a colon.\
Check DST (Daylight Saving Time) if appropriate.</li>\
<li>Choose the correct <b>Timezone</b>. If you do need another timezone select the option <i>LMT</i>. \
If you do so, you can enter the longitude wherefore you want to calculate the time in the input field \
  <b>Define local time zone</b>. This works the same way as for longitude.</li></ul>
help.chartsmidpoints.title=Midpoints
help.chartsmidpoints.content=Here you will find an overview of the midpoints. Enigma calculates the midpoints \
  for different disktypes as used by Uranian astrologers and people who use the Ebertin system.<br> <br>\
  Enigma supports the following disktypes:\
  <ul><li>360&deg;</li><li>90&deg;</li><li>45&deg;</li><li>22,5&deg;</li></ul><br> \
  You cannot yet define the orb which is currently fixed at 1&deg;36'.<br><br>\
  The list contains all midpoints. <br>\
  <ul><li>The fist two columns contain the points that together form the midpoint.</li> \
  <li>The type of disk is in the third column, named <i>Disk</i>.</li>\
  <li>The fourth column shows the point that is actually at the midpoint.</li> \
  <li>The actual orb is in the fifth column, named <i>Orb</i>.</li>\
  <li>And in the sixth and last column, named <i>Perc.</i> you will find the percentage of the orb. \
  The percentage indicates the relative size of teh orb. The higher the percentage, the less the strength of the \
  midpoint.</li></ul>\

  Enigma calculates each chart with the configuration that is currently active.<br>\
  You will find the settings for this configurations in the lower part of the screen.<br>\
  If you want to select another configuration, edit an existing configuration or create a new one, \
  you need to click the button <b>Config</b>. \
  After changing a configuration the charts that are shown in the list will automatically use the new configuration.<br>\
  Only the tables and charts that are already opened will not change. \
  This makes it possible to compare the same chart using different configurations.
help.chartstetenburg.title=Help for ciritical point Tetenburg
help.chartstetenburg.content=In 1990 the dutch astrologer Ton Tetenburg introduced a system for the calculation of possible moments of death and for other \
  ciritical events.<br>\
  He claims that the critical point as proposed by him, will make an aspect with 5 minutes of arc at critical moments.<br><br>\
  The calculation is a specific primary direction of the ascendant.<br>\
  Tetenburg uses the following approach:\
  <ul><li>Define the daily movement of the Sun during the day of birth as time key.</li>\
  <li>Multiply the number of days since birth with this time key.</li>\
  <li>Add the result to the length of the MC.</li>\
  <li>Calculate the ascendant for the resulting progressed MC.</li>\
  <li>This is the critical point.</li></ul><br>\
  In the screen you enter the date for the event you want to research. Use the format yyyyy/mm/dd.<br>\
  If you make a mistake the inputfield is colored yellow.<br>\
  After entering the date click the button <b>Calculate</b> and Enigma shows the length of the critical point.<br><br>\
  Location, timezone and any indication of DST are the same as used for the radix. <br>\
  The time is 00:00:00.<br><br> \
